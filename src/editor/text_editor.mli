(** [editor_state] type contains text, cursor_pos, selection_start,
    selection_end. [text] stores every line of the input text file as a string,
    and text field itself is a string list. [cursor_pos] stores the current
    cursor position. [selection_start] indicates the start position of the
    selection/highlight. [selection_end] indicates the end position of the
    selection/highlight.*)

val create_editor_state : unit -> editor_state
(** [create_editor_state ()] creates a new editor_state with no file, no cursor
    position, and no selection positions. *)

val load_file : string -> editor_state
(** [load_file f] reads in a .txt file from the current directory with the name
    the same as string f, and show the file as a editor_state. Every line is

(** [update_in_one_row state s start_pos_r start_pos_c end_pos_c] updates one
    line, with the start position of selection and end position of selection in
    the same row. *)

val update_row : editor_state -> string -> string
(** [update_row state s] updates the text in the given state based on the
    selected portion. If the start and end of the selection are in the same row,
    it uses the helper function update_in_one_row to update the text. If they
    are in different rows, it extracts the prefix from the start row and the
    suffix from the end row and concatenates these with the new string.*)

val update_all_rows : editor_state -> string -> string list
(** [update_row state s] updates the text in the given state by replacing the
    text in the rows between the selection start and end with a single new row. *)

val get_nth_elm : string list -> int -> string
(** [get_nth_elm s pos] get the number [pos]th element, which is a string, in
    the editor_state [s].*)

val select_text : editor_state -> int -> int -> int -> int -> editor_state
(** [select_text s sr sc er ec] selects text in editor_state from "row start
    position" sr and "column start position" sc (inclusive), to "row end
    position" er and "column end position" ec (inclusive). Returns the new
    editor_state. *)

val replace_str : editor_state -> string -> editor_state
(** [replace_str s str] returns a new editor_state after replacing the text from
    index selection_start (inclusive) to index selection_end (exclusive) with
    string str. If multiple lines are selected, then replace all the select
    words with the new string, and merge the multiples lines that are selected. *)

val insert_str : editor_state -> int -> int -> string -> editor_state
(** [insert_str s r c str] returns a new editor_state after inserting the text
    string str within at position row r and column cle. *)

val delete : editor_state -> editor_state
(** [delete s] takes in a state s and delete the letter before the current
    cursor position. *)

val delete_selection : editor_state -> editor_state
(** [delete_selection s] takes in a state s and delete the letter(s) within the
    selection range. *)

val move_cursor : editor_state -> int * int -> editor_state
(** [move_cursor s (r c)] changes the cursor position by adding the row offset r
    and the column offset c to the current cursor position. *)

val count_words_from_string : string -> int
(** [count_words_from_string s] returns the word count of the one of the string
    in s.text, which is the word count of one line of the text string list. *)

val word_count : editor_state -> int
(** [word_count s] returns the word count of the editor_state s*)

val capitalize : editor_state -> string list
(** [capitalize s1] returns a new state s2 with all of its ascii characters
    capitalized*)

val fold : editor_state -> (string -> string) -> string list
(** [fold s f] takes in a state s and a user function (string -> string), and
    returns a new state with f applied to all of the columns of state s*)

val is_last_insert_space : editor_state -> editor_state
(** [is_last_insert_space s] takes in an editor_state s and return a new
    editor_state with a space appended to the end of every line. *)

val convert_selection_to_string_list : editor_state -> string list
(** [convert_selection_to_string s] converts the selected string into string
    list based on selection start and selection end *)

val insert_newline : editor_state -> editor_state
(** [insert_newline s] takes a editor state and add a new line at cursor pos*)
